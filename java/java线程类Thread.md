# Java线程
java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean：java虚拟机的线程系统的管理接口，JVM对该接口有简单实现，可以通过ManagementFactory#getThreadMXBean获取当前的ThreadMXBean；

## Java线程的创建方式
* 实现Runnable接口
自定义类实现Runnable接口，需要重写其中的run方法，启动线程时，将自定义类的实例作为一个参数，调用Thread的构造方法，得到一个线程实例，再调用start方法启动。形如：
`new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start()`;
* 继承Thread类
通过继承Thread的方式，可以创建一个线程，需要重写其中的run方法，启动线程时，通过调用start方法启动。使用方式：
`new MyThread().start()`;
* 实现Callable接口
通过实现callable接口的方式，可以创建一个线程，需要重写其中的call方法。启动线程时，需要新建一个Callable的实例，再用FutureTask实例包装它，
* 最终，再包装成Thread实例，调用start方法启动，并且，可以通过FutureTask的get方法来获取返回值。形如：
```java
Callable<Integer> myCall = new MyCallable();
FutureTask<Integer> ft = new FutureTask<>(myCall);
new Thread(ft).start();
try{
    ft.get();
}catch(InterruptedException|ExecutionException e){
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Callable接口接口可以获取返回值和异常，查看FutureTask的源码，发现Callable是通过Future特性获取到结果和Callable执行的异常的；

## Thread类
结合源码（jdk1.8）,看看该类的注释说明，类的注释给出了详细说明还有样例：
>在某个线程中创建一个新线程，新线程的优先级和创建新线程的线程一致，如果创建线程是守护线程的话，则新线程是守护线程。当Java虚拟机启动时，通常有一个非守护线程（即main线程，调用指定类的main方法），Java虚拟机会继续执行这些线程,直到发生如下情形之一：
* 调用了类Runtime的exit()方法，并且安全管理器允许发生退出操作。
* 所有非守护线程均已死亡，可以是通过执行完run方法后返回，也可以是执行run方法时抛出了异常。

>创建新的执行线程的两种方法：
* 声明一个Thread类的子类，子类中重写Thread类的run方法。
* 声明一个实现Runnable接口的类，类中实现run方法。

>每个线程都有一个名字以供识别。线程名字可以相同。如果创建线程时未指定名字，会分配一个新名字。
>除非特殊说明，否则将null参数传递给Thread类的构造器或者方法中会导致NullPointerException

Thread有很多构造方法，可以参见最后一个方法的说明
```java
public class Thread implements Runnable {
    public Thread(Runnable target) {
        init(null, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
    }

    Thread(Runnable target, AccessControlContext acc) {
        init(null, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0, acc, false);
    }

    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target) {
        init(group, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
    }

    public Thread(String name) {
        init(null, null, name, 0);
    }

    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, String name) {
        init(group, null, name, 0);
    }

    public Thread(Runnable target, String name) {
        init(null, target, name, 0);
    }

    public Thread(ThreadGroup group, Runnable target, String name) {
        init(group, target, name, 0);
    }

    /**
     * Allocates a new {@code Thread} object so that it has {@code target}
     * as its run object, has the specified {@code name} as its name,
     * and belongs to the thread group referred to by {@code group}, and has
     * the specified <i>stack size</i>.
     *
     * <p>This constructor is identical to {@link
     * #Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)} with the exception of the fact
     * that it allows the thread stack size to be specified.  The stack size
     * is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
     * machine is to allocate for this thread's stack.  <b>The effect of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.</b>
     *
     * <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
     * recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
     * Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
     * threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
     * OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of
     * the relationship between the value of the <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter
     * and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
     * platform-dependent.  <b>On some platforms, the value of the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter may have no effect whatsoever.</b>
     *
     * <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
     * parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
     * for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this
     * variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required,
     * and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
     * which an application is to run.</i>
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: Java platform implementers are encouraged to
     * document their implementation's behavior with respect to the
     * {@code stackSize} parameter.

#### 中断方法
线程的中断机制[参考](https://www.zhihu.com/question/41048032)
java线程的中断只是提供了一种中断标识，主要的标识标记和根据标识实现逻辑需要用户根据标识来自己实现中断处理；
> interrupt()：设置线程中断标识为中断，特别需要注意如果是阻塞态，会抛出InterruptedException，同时阻塞标识设置为false
> isInterrupted()：查询线程的终端标识
> interrupted()：static方法，查询当前线程的终端标识，特别注意该方法会重置标识为false

#### join方法
等待线程生命周期结束,本质是当线程alive()时一直循环等待
> public final void join()
> public final synchronized void join(long millis)
> public final synchronized void join(long millis, int nanos)

```java
public final synchronized void join(long millis)
    throws InterruptedException {
    long base = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long now = 0;

    if (millis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
    }

    if (millis == 0) {
        while (isAlive()) {
            wait(0);
        }
    } else {
        while (isAlive()) {
            long delay = millis - now;
            if (delay <= 0) {
                break;
            }
            wait(delay);
            now = System.currentTimeMillis() - base;
        }
    }
}
```
通过synchronized关键字获取到生成对象的锁，调用生成线程的wait方法阻塞，生成线程结束后通知主线程执行；

#### 废弃的stop方法

```java
    /**
     * Forces the thread to stop executing.
     * <p>
     * If there is a security manager installed, its <code>checkAccess</code>
     * method is called with <code>this</code>
     * as its argument. This may result in a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> being raised (in the current thread).
     * <p>
     * If this thread is different from the current thread (that is, the current
     * thread is trying to stop a thread other than itself), the
     * security manager's <code>checkPermission</code> method (with a
     * <code>RuntimePermission("stopThread")</code> argument) is called in
     * addition.
     * Again, this may result in throwing a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> (in the current thread).
     * <p>
     * The thread represented by this thread is forced to stop whatever
     * it is doing abnormally and to throw a newly created
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> object as an exception.
     * <p>
     * It is permitted to stop a thread that has not yet been started.
     * If the thread is eventually started, it immediately terminates.
     * <p>
     * An application should not normally try to catch
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> unless it must do some extraordinary
     * cleanup operation (note that the throwing of
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> causes <code>finally</code> clauses of
     * <code>try</code> statements to be executed before the thread
     * officially dies).  If a <code>catch</code> clause catches a
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code> object, it is important to rethrow the
     * object so that the thread actually dies.
     * <p>
     * The top-level error handler that reacts to otherwise uncaught
     * exceptions does not print out a message or otherwise notify the
     * application if the uncaught exception is an instance of
     * <code>ThreadDeath</code>.
     *
     * @exception  SecurityException  if the current thread cannot
     *               modify this thread.

     * @deprecated This method is inherently unsafe.  Stopping a thread with
     *       Thread.stop causes it to unlock all of the monitors that it
     *       has locked (as a natural consequence of the unchecked
     *       <code>ThreadDeath</code> exception propagating up the stack).  If
     *       any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
     *       an inconsistent state, the damaged objects become visible to
     *       other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.  Many
     *       uses of <code>stop</code> should be replaced by code that simply
     *       modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
     *       stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
     *       regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
     *       if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.  If the
     *       target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
     *       for example), the <code>interrupt</code> method should be used to
     *       interrupt the wait.
     *       For more information, see
     *       <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why
